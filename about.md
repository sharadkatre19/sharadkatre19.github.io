My name is SHARAD KATRE. I’m a passionate and driven software developer with a deep love for learning and problem-solving. A self-starter by nature, I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy diving into new technologies to expand my skill set. My foundation lies in JavaScript, and I enjoy leveraging it across the full stack to build modern, scalable, and impactful web applications. With a strong enthusiasm for open web development, I’m always exploring innovative ways to make the web more accessible and dynamic. Whether it’s frontend design, backend logic, or full-stack integration, I bring curiosity, creativity, and a can-do attitude to every project. I’m currently open to new opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate with like-minded teams building meaningful digital experiences.
